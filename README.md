## General Information <a name="general-information"></a>
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics
company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want
to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different
gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV
without using a remote.
The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the
TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command

**About Dataset:**

- *Dataset Overview:* The dataset for the project comprises several hundred
videos, each belonging to one of five distinct classes. These classes
represent different gestures. Each video is relatively short, typically lasting 2
to 3 seconds. The videos are further divided into a sequence of 30 frames or
images, capturing the progression of the gesture over time.

- *Gestures and Classes:* The dataset's videos showcase individuals
performing gestures in front of a webcam. These gestures are categorized int
five specific classes. Each class represents a distinct action or motion, such
as raising a thumb, lowering a thumb, swiping left, swiping right, and stopping

- *Variety and Source:* The videos in the dataset are captured by different
individuals, resulting in a diverse range of appearances, backgrounds, and
execution styles. The videos emulate the interaction one might have with a
smart TV, making them relevant for the intended application, possibly involvin
gesture-based control of a TV interface.

**Goal:**
This endeavor aims to construct a sophisticated model designed for the
recognition of five distinct hand gestures. The primary objective involves
training a model utilizing the data contained within the 'train' directory,
with a specific emphasis on achieving commendable performance across
the 'validationâ€™, adhering to established practices in the realm of machine
learning. It is important to note that the 'test' folder has been reserved
exclusively for the purpose of evaluation, where the efficacy of the
finalized model will be rigorously assessed.
